# IBM Skilled Python Practice

## Overview

This repository contains Python practice notebooks and exercises completed as part of the **IBM Skills Network – PY0101EN (Python Basics for Data Science)** course. It documents my hands-on learning journey from foundational Python concepts to intermediate topics such as numerical computing and API integration.

The repository is intended to serve as:

* A structured learning archive
* A reference for core Python concepts
* Evidence of practical coursework completed through IBM Skills Network
